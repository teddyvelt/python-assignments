# photoresistor.py  -  the FAKE photoresistor ENGINE (the HAL uses this for you)
#
# You do NOT use this file directly. The HAL calls it, so in your program you
# just talk to the hardware layer like everything else:
#
#     hw.play("SOS")          # make the fake sensor "see" a message (test only)
#     value = hw.read_u16()   # read the light level, like any ADC pin
#
# TWO MODES (pick one with the switch below):
#
#   STEP_MODE = False  ->  REAL TIME. The signal follows the wall clock, exactly
#                          like real hardware. Great for the real experience, but
#                          you CANNOT single-step it in a debugger - the clock
#                          keeps moving while you are paused, so the signal races
#                          ahead of your code.
#
#   STEP_MODE = True   ->  ONE SAMPLE PER READ. The signal advances only when
#                          read_u16() is called, so it WAITS for you. Set a
#                          breakpoint, step line by line, watch the values - the
#                          signal moves one sample each read, perfectly in sync.
#                          (The sleep in your loop no longer sets the rate here,
#                          so this mode is for debugging the LOGIC, not for
#                          teaching the sampling rate.)
#
# read_u16() works the same in both modes, so main.py and your receiver never
# change.
